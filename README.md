#Iced_Boilerplate
A staring point for [Iced](https://github.com/hecrj/iced)

"Elm-like" GUI frameworks usually require quite a bit of boilerplate to start. This repository aims at simplifying that process.

While not designed to teach Iced, this boilerplate tries to use comments to be beginner friendly.

Currently there is no command to run like 'create-react-app', for now it is simply a repo to clone.
